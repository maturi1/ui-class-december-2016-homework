Homework 2:
1.	Write a program in javascript to print the least value of variables a and b? (flow chart and program)?
2.Difference b/w == and ===?
== displays the comparison of the given value.
Ex: var x = 3;
      X == 5;
The output is false as 3 is not equal to 5.
=== display the value of comparison of same type.
Ex: var x = 1;
      Var y = 2;
       X === 1;
       Y === “2”;
The output is true and false. In the second statement the type is not equal to the y value.

3.	Logical and (&&) , logical or (||) , logical not(!)
Logical and(&&) operator returns true if both the expressions are true or else it returns false.
Ex: var x = 3;
       Var y = 5;
(x >1 && y>1); 
output: true because in this both statements are true.
(x<1 && y>1)
Output: false , in this both statements are not true. So it will shown as false.
               Logical or(||) operator returns true when any one of the expression is true, or else false.
               Ex: var x=4;
                      Var y=3;
                   (x ===3 || y ===3);
              Output: true because one of the expression is true so it shows true.
Logical not(!) operator returns true for false statements and false for true statements.
Ex: 
<script>
 var x = 3;
        Var y = 4;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = !(x == y) + “<br>” + !(x < y); 
</script>
The output is true
                         false

4.	Decimal to hexa decimal conversion 45?
1.Divide the decimal number by 16.   Treat the division as an integer division.  
2.Write down the remainder (in hexadecimal).
3.Divide the result again by 16.  Treat the division as an integer division.  
4.Repeat step 2 and 3 until result is 0.
5.The hex value is the digit sequence of the remainders from the last to first.
45:    45/16  = 2.813
          The remainder 0.813 is divided by 16 which is 13 i.e., D in hexadecimal. So final answer is 2D.           45 = 2D.

5.	Hexa decimal to decimal FF?
1.Get the last digit of the hex number, call this digit the currentDigit.  
2.Make a variable, let's call it power.  Set the value to 0.
3.Multiply the current digit with (16^power), store the result.
4.Increment power by 1.
5.Set the the currentDigit to the previous digit of the hex number.
6.Repeat from step 3 until all digits have been multiplied.
7.Sum the result of step 3 to get the answer number.
FF:  in hexadecimal F decimal value is 15.
       F     F
      15   15
       15*16^1 + 15*16^0   
      = 15*16 + 15*1
      = 240 + 15
FF      = 255

6.	Hexadecimal to octal 23?
To convert hexadecimal to octal first we need to convert the hexadecimal number to the decimal form and from decimal form to octal.
Follow the steps of hexadecimal to decimal form. After that
Step 1: Divide the decimal number with 8
Step 2: Note down the remainder
Step 3: Continue step 1 and 2 with the quotient, until the quotient is zero
Step 4: Write the remainders in reverse order
Step 5: The obtained number is the required result.

23:     convert hexadecimal to decimal form.
           23 = 2*16^1 + 3*16^0
                = 32 + 3 
                = 35
     The decimal form of 23 is 35.
Now convert decimal to octal.
35         35/8      result :  4         remainder : 3
              4/8                       0                              4
The octal number is 43.


7.	Octal to hexadecimal 76?
Step 1: Let the number of digits in the number be n
Step 2: Multiply the digits with 8n-1where n is position of digit from the right end of the number. 
Step 3: Add the terms after multiplication
Step 4: The obtained number is equivalent decimal number to the given octal
Step 5: Consider the decimal number,divide it by 16
Step 6: Note the remainder.
Step 7: Continue the process till the quotient in zero
Step 8: Write the remainder in the reverse order
Step 9: The obtained number is equivalent hexadecimal number to the given octa decimal number.

76: coverting octal to decimal
             7*8^1 + 6*8^0
           = 56 + 6
           = 62
Converting decimal number 62 to hexadecimal.
 62:        62/16           result: 3     remainder : 14
                3/16                         0                            3
    62 =   3  14   where 14 is E so answer is
         = 3E 
 Hexadecimal number of 62 is 3E
