What is an event handler?
Event methods trigger or attach a function to an event for the selected elements. Those functions call event handler. There are many methods to handle events.
Bind(), blur(), click(), unbind(),delegate(), die() etc.. 
What is event delegation in java script and jquery?
In jQuery Event delegation allows us to attach a single event listener, to a parent element, that will fire for all descendants matching a selector, whether those descendants exist now or are added in the future.
Event delegation refers to the process of using event propagation (bubbling) to handle events at a higher level in the DOM than the element on which the event originated. It allows us to attach a single event listener for elements that exist now or in the future.
.delegate( selector, events )
Selecter is to filter the elements
Events are the plain objects of one or more and functions to execute for them.
JavaScript event delegation is a simple technique by which, add a single event handler to a parent element in order to avoid having to add event handlers to multiple child elements.
Event handler methods:
.Click:  attaches the click event
.Bind: attach a handler to an event.
.Delegate: Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements.
.delegate(selector,events)
.Live: Attach an event handler for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future.
.on: attaches event handlers to elements.

JQuery chaining method:
Chaining method allows multiple jQuery elements at a single statement.
$("#p1").css("color", "black").slideUp(2000).slideDown(2000);
In this example all these commands will execute one by one first the command will change to red color and then it slideup and slide down.
