Homework 8:
1.what are psuedo classes?
Psuedo classes are combine with css and defines special state of an element.
Syntax:  selector:pseudo-class {
    property:value;
}
<style>
a.highlight:hover {
    color: blue;
} 
</style> 
When we hover on any style the color of the link will be changed.
Hover on <div>
<style>
div {
    background-color: green;
    color: white;
    padding: 25px;
    text-align: center;
}
div:hover {
    background-color: blue;
}
</style>
In this example when we move the mouse over the div element the color will changes to blue.
Simple tooltip hover:
When we want to move the cursor to the div element then it will display <p> element.
:first-child pseudo-class matches a specified element that is the first child of another element.
the selector matches the first <i> element in all <p> elements:
<style>
p i:first-child {
    color: blue;
} 
</style>
</head>
<body>
<p>I am a <i>strong</i> person. I am a <i>strong</i> person.</p>
</body> 
The output will be the first strong word will turn to blue in each sentence. Because it is the first child of the <p> element.
the selector matches all <i> elements in <p> elements that are the first child of another element.
By using the above example the selector will display all strong words in blue color in first <p> element. It displays all child elements in a <p> element.
The :lang pseudo-class allows you to define special rules for different languages.
<style>
q:lang(no) {
    quotes: "~" "~";
}
</style>
In this example the :lang will display in between the text wherever we want.
